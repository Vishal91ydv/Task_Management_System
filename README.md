# About Project
This project is a Task Management System that allows users to register, log in, and manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can create, update, delete, and track their tasks with real-time status updates.
The system uses Reactjs for the frontend, Node.js + Express for the backend, and Mongodb as the database.
It provides secure authentication using JWT and password hashing with bcrypt to ensure data privacy and user security.

# Set Mongodb URI in .env file
MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
